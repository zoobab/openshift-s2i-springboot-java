# Create a Spring Boot Application S2I builder image for OpenShift CP v3.6+

## A. Creating the S2I builder image and testing it.

**NOTE:**
If you only want to use this S2I builder image to build and deploy your Spring Boot Java Application, then you can skip this step and go to Step [B].

#### Dockerfile
The *Dockerfile* installs all of the necessary build tools and libraries that are needed to build and run a Spring Boot Java application within an embedded Web Server such as Apache Tomcat (/ Jetty) Web Server.  Executing a docker build will produce an S2I builder image which can be deployed on OpenShift and used to build a Spring Boot application.  Both source and binary (war files) formats of the Spring Boot application are supported.  When a *pom.xml* file is present in the application source directory, **Apache Maven** will be used to build the application source code.  Alternatively, if a *build.gradle* file is present, **Gradle** will be used to build the application source.

#### S2I scripts

##### assemble
The *assemble* script executes the following steps:
1. Copies the application source code from */tmp/src* to the home directory of the container base image (springboot-java).  */opt/app-root/src* is the application **Source** directory and also the home directory of the container base image.
2. Checks the value of the environment variable *BUILD_TYPE*.  By default, the value of this variable is set to 'Maven'.  For executing 'Gradle' builds, the value of this enviroment variable should be set to 'Gradle'.
3. Checks if *pom.xml* file exists in **Source** directory. If the file exists and *BUILD_TYPE* is set to 'Maven', a Maven Build is executed.  If the Maven build succeeds (returns 0) then the built application binary file (Fat Jar) is copied to the destination directory */opt/openshift*. A new image containing the built application is committed and saved as the *application container image*.
4. Checks if *build.gradle* file exists in **Source** directory. If the file exists and *BUILD_TYPE* is set to 'Gradle', a Gradle Build is executed.  If the Gradle build succeeds (returns 0) then the built application binary file (Fat Jar) is copied to the destination directory */opt/openshift*. A new image containing the built application is committed and saved as the *application container image* in the integrated Docker registry.
5. If the application build fails in steps 3 or 4, then an error message is returned and execution is stopped. In this case, no *application container image* is created.
6. If a *pom.xml* or *build.gradle* file does not exist in the **Source** directory then the contents of this directory is assumed to contain a single application binary file (Fat Jar).  This binary file will be copied to the destination directory */opt/openshift* and a new container image containing this application binary will be committed and saved as a new *application container image*.

The script also restores any saved artifacts from the previous image build.

##### run
The *run* script is used to start/run the Spring Boot application.

##### save-artifacts (optional)
The *save-artifacts* script allows a new build to reuse content (dependencies) from a previous version of the application image.

##### usage (optional) 
The *usage* script prints out instructions on how to use the Spring Boot Java S2I builder image in order to produce an **Application Container Image**.

#### Create the Spring Boot Application S2I builder image
The following command will create a S2I builder image named **springboot-java** based on the Dockerfile.
```
docker build -t springboot-java .
```

The command *'s2i usage springboot-java'* will print out the help info. defined in the *usage* script.

#### Testing the S2I builder image
The builder image can be tested using the following commands:
```
docker build -t springboot-java-candidate .
IMAGE_NAME=springboot-java-candidate test/run
```

#### Creating the *Application Container Image*
The application container image contains the built application binary which is layered on top of the builder (base) image.  The following command will create the application container image:

**Usage:**
```
s2i build <location of source code> <S2I builder image name> <application container image name>
```

```
s2i build test/test-app springboot-java po-service-app
---> Building and installing application from source...
```
Based on the logic defined in the *assemble* script, s2i will create an application container image using the supplied S2I builder image and the application source code from the *test/test-app* directory. 

#### Running the application container image
Running the application image is as simple as invoking the docker run command:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 po-service-app
```
The application *po-service-app*, should now be accessible at  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Using the saved artifacts script
Rebuilding the application using the saved artifacts can be accomplished using the following command:
```
s2i build --incremental=true test/test-app springboot-java po-service-app
---> Restoring build artifacts...
---> Building and installing application from source...
```
This will run the *save-artifacts* script which includes the code to backup the currently running application dependencies. When the application container image is built next time, the saved application dependencies will be re-used to build the application.

## B. Using the Spring Boot Application S2I builder image in OpenShift CP

1.  Use the command below to create the S2I builder image and save it in the integrated docker registry.  The command below tags the builder image to the current project in the integrated registry.

```
oc new-build --strategy=docker --name=springboot-java https://github.com/ganrad/openshift-s2i-springboot-java.git
```

2.  Download the *s2i-springboot.json* template file from this repository and save it on your local machine where you have OpenShift CLI tools (oc binary) installed. Then use the command below to upload the template into your current project/namespace.

```
oc create -f s2i-springboot.json
```

3.  Click on 'Add to Project' in OpenShift CP Web Console (UI) to create a new application and then select the 'springboot-java' template from the 'Browse' images tab.  You will then be presented with a form where you can specify 
* A *name* for your web application and 
* The GitHub repository URL containing your Spring Boot Java application source code.
* (Optional) Specify the application build type - Maven (Default) or Gradle.
* (Optional) Specify application runtime arguments.

    Next, click on 'Create' application.  This will invoke the *S2I process* which will build your application, containerize your application (as explained above), push the newly built image into the integrated docker registry and finally deploy a Pod containing your application.

Congrats!  You have now successfully created your own S2I builder image for building and deploying containerized Spring Boot Java Web applications on OpenShift CP.
